# Dev Notes

2023-07-13

## Accomplishments 🏆

- Compiled and ran "Hello, world!" successfully
- Allegedly retrieved a `json_object *` after executing `jason_tokener_new()`

## Recap ⏪

- We're relying on the [json-c](https://github.com/json-c/json-c) library to wrangle JSON.
  - When pairing we built from source, but somehow resolution of the dependency binaries (e.g., linking) \*just happens\* (i.e., we could delete `json-c` and `json-c-build` and still compile and run `main`).
  - Ravi downloaded via `brew` rather than building from source; this is so there is a `json-c.pc` file containing metadata about `json-c` that `pkg-config` can find.
    - **NOTE**: Ravi added some configs so we can use `pkg-config` to help us retrieve information about installed libraries and their associated compilation and linking flags.

## TODOs 📝

- [x] Ravi: Get NeoVim set up for "some C-rious C development"
- [x] Ravi: Download `json-c` locally, replicate same behavior of `main` from pairing session
