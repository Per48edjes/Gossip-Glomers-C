## Accomplishments 🏆

- We're able to read a _line_ of JSON from STDIN into our program.
- We know a more terse way to construct a `json_object` from a string using `json_tokener_parse`.
- We can use the `json-c` API to extract contained objects from a `json_object` and print parsed JSON string.
- We have a way to manually construct JSON, but still have questions whether this is the most ergonomic way to do things and whether we're managing memory correctly.

## Recap ⏪

- `json-c` has a non-`_ex` API that seems to be simpler
- `getline` functionality reuses its own buffer for subsequent reads
- Kevan is becoming fast friends with with Copilot and chatGPT

## TODOs 📝

- [x] Ravi: Figure out how to manually disable fixers
- [x] Ravi: Find out if there is a `valgrind` equivalent for macOS
- [ ] Ravi: Print "init_okay" response to STDOUT
- [ ] Kevan: Spend 30 mins. reading `json-c` docs on "ownership"
